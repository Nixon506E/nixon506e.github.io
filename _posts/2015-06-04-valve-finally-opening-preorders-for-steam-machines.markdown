# [Valve Finally Opening Preorders for Steam Machines](http://www.theverge.com/2015/6/4/8728813/valve-steam-machine-preorder-release-date)

After years of using Steam Big Picture Mode the official SteamOS may finally become a part of the average user's home theater and PCs can take their place next to consoles in the average home, that kind of competition truly excites me.
